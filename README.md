# DynamoDB Query Plugin For Obsidian

> This plugin for Obsidian.md allows you to perform simple AWS DynamoDB queries within your markdown documentation. It was originally designed to aid in single table design.

You create a code block with the type `dynamodb` and inside it write your query. You can use PartiQL or pass the parameters just as you would when using the DynamoDB client in the AWS SDK.
